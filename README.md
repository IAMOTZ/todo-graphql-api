# Todo GraphQL API
A simple Todo API implemented with GraphQL. I used [`express-graphql`](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql) to implement the GraphQL server.

## Features:
- Create Todo
- Fetch All Todos
- Fetch Single Todo
- Edit Todo
- Delete Todo
- Categorise Todo

## If you want to play around this project:
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/IAMOTZ/todo-graphql-api.git`
- Change into the root directory of the project
- Use `npm install` to install all the required dependencies
- Use `npm start` to start the app. The app should start on port `7777`.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:7777/graphql` to view the `GraphiQL` playground
- Use the Documentation Explorer to explore the possible queries/mutations you can send to the GraphQL server.
